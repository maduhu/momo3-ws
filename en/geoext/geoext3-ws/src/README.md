# GeoExt3 workshop

![](gx-logo-plain.png)

Welcome to the GeoExt3 workshop, in which you'll learn how to use GeoExt3 in
your ExtJS applications.

This workshop is composed out of several modules, which usually are done in
order.

* Before diving into programming, the [metainformation](meta/intro.md)
  chapter has a lot of information about this workshop, the intended audience
  and how to best create solutions for the workshop.
* Afterwards we'll work through the [first steps](first-steps/intro.md) chapter, in
  which you learn about Openlayers, ExtJS and GeoExt3.
* Now that we know these libraries and frameworks, we are ready to use the
  `GeoExt.component.Map` in the [map](map-component/intro.md) chapter.
* Your map may very well contain a lot of layers, these can be managed with a
  [layer tree](layer-tree/intro.md).
* The next chapter is all about [vector features](feature-grid/intro.md),
  you'll create a grid that is synced with a vector layer in the map.
* The last chapter shows [other aspects](other/intro.md) of GeoExt components
  like popups, an embeddable overview map, the utility classes to talk to MapFish print servers and other parts of GeoExt.
