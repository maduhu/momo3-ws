# GeoServer

![](assets/geoserver-logo.png)

GeoServer is an Open Source software server written in Java that allows users
to share and edit geospatial data. Designed for interoperability, it publishes
data from any major spatial data source using open standards.
GeoServer is the reference implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
Web Feature Service (WFS) and Web Coverage Service (WCS) standards, as well as
a high performance certified compliant Web Map Service (WMS). GeoServer forms
a core component of the Geospatial Web.

In this module we will focus on the geodata-management using the GeoServer
administration frontend. Thus we will learn both how to set the most common
configure options and how to load, publish, style, and share geospatial data
with GeoServer.

The workshop is subdivided into two main categories:

* [GeoServer Basics (Administration & Publishing)](basics/README.md)
* [GeoServer Advanced (REST & GeoWebCache)](advanced/README.md)

> **note** Parts of this workshop are heavily inspired by workshops prepared
by the [GeoServer community](http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/index.html)
and [boundless](https://github.com/boundlessgeo/workshops/blob/master/workshops/geoserver/intro/slides/slides.rst).
