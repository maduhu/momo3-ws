# Creating a new resource

In this exercise we are going to use the REST interface in combination with the
HTTP operations `POST` and `PUT` to *create* a resource on the server. In
contrast to the previous module here we are going to use the command line tool
*cURL* to access the catalog. *cURL* is a command line tool to transfer data from
or to a server using one of the supported protocols (e.g. HTTP or FTP). For more
about the tool have a look at [here](https://curl.haxx.se/).

## Creating a new workspace

In this module we are going to repeat the steps we have done in chapter
[Publishing a vector layer](../../basics/publishing/vector/README.md). But as we
don't want to override our progress (or any individual changes) made to the
workspace `momo`, we will create new workspace `momo-rest` for the ensuing
exercises.

* Open up the terminal (if not already openend) and type in the following
  command to create a new workspace named `momo-rest`:
  ```bash
  $ curl \
    -v \
    -u admin:momo-ws\
    -XPOST \
    -H "Content-type: text/xml" \
    -d "<workspace>
          <name>momo-rest</name>
        </workspace>" \
    {{ book.geoServerBaseUrl }}/rest/workspaces
  ```
The call above differs in two essential points from the previous read operations:
Unlike the HTTP operation `GET` we use the operation `POST` and in addition we
transfer a `XML` content containing a simple workspace definition to the unique
endpoint `workspaces`.
* Hit `Enter` to execute the above command and you will see an output like this:
  ```
  * Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache
  *   Trying 127.0.0.1...
  * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 80 (#0)
  * Server auth using Basic with user 'admin'
  > POST /geoserver/rest/workspaces HTTP/1.1
  > Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46Z2Vvc2VydmVy
  > User-Agent: curl/7.35.0
  > Host: localhost:80
  > Accept: */*
  > Content-type: text/xml
  > Content-Length: 57
  >
  * upload completely sent off: 57 out of 57 bytes
  < HTTP/1.1 201 Created
  < Date: Wed, 03 Feb 2016 10:30:39 GMT
  < Location: http://localhost:80/geoserver/rest/workspaces/momo-rest
  * Server Noelios-Restlet-Engine/1.0..8 is not blacklisted
  < Server: Noelios-Restlet-Engine/1.0..8
  < Transfer-Encoding: chunked
  <
  * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
  ```
Here, two informations are crucial to us:
  * `HTTP/1.1 201 Created`: The request has been successfully processed and
    the resource has been created.
  * `{{ book.geoServerBaseUrl }}/rest/workspaces/momo-rest`: The REST endpoint
    URL of our new workspace.
* We can verify that the workspace was actually created either by using the
  GeoServer UI or the REST interface:
    * Open the GeoServer [user interface]({{ book.geoServerBaseUrl }}), navigate
      to the page `Data` &#10093; `Workspaces` and ensure a new workspace named
      `momo-rest` is available in the list.
    * Open the terminal and run the following command to get a `XML` representation
      of all available workspaces:
    ```bash
    $ curl \
        -v \
        -u admin:momo-ws \
        -XGET \
        -H "Accept: text/xml" \
        {{ book.geoServerBaseUrl }}/rest/workspaces
    ```

## Creating a new store

Now that we have created a new workspace, we'll add a new data store to it. Here
we are reusing the database we already [created](../../basics/publishing/prerequisites.md) (and
added to the geoserver).

* Open the terminal and insert the following command to create a new PostGIS
  datastore named `db_momo_ws_rest`:
```bash
$ curl \
    -v \
    -u admin:momo-ws \
    -XPOST \
    -H "Content-type: text/xml" \
    -d "<dataStore>
          <name>db_momo_ws_rest</name>
          <connectionParameters>
            <host>localhost</host>
            <port>5432</port>
            <database>db_momo_ws</database>
            <schema>geodata</schema>
            <user>momo</user>
            <passwd>momo</passwd>
            <dbtype>postgis</dbtype>
          </connectionParameters>
        </dataStore>" \
    {{ book.geoServerBaseUrl }}/rest/workspaces/momo-rest/datastores
```
* Hit `Enter` to execute the command. This will result in the following output,
  assuring that the store was successfully created:
  ```
  * Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache
  *   Trying 127.0.0.1...
  * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 80 (#0)
  * Server auth using Basic with user 'admin'
  > POST /geoserver/rest/workspaces/momo-rest/datastores HTTP/1.1
  > Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46Z2Vvc2VydmVy
  > User-Agent: curl/7.35.0
  > Host: localhost:80
  > Accept: */*
  > Content-type: text/xml
  > Content-Length: 347
  >
  * upload completely sent off: 347 out of 347 bytes
  < HTTP/1.1 201 Created
  < Date: Wed, 03 Feb 2016 10:59:04 GMT
  < Location: http://localhost:80/geoserver/rest/workspaces/momo-rest/datastores/db_momo_ws_rest
  * Server Noelios-Restlet-Engine/1.0..8 is not blacklisted
  < Server: Noelios-Restlet-Engine/1.0..8
  < Transfer-Encoding: chunked
  <
  * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
  ```
* Once again we can verify the successful creation in the GeoServer UI (`Data`
  &#10093; `Stores`).

## Publishing a layer

In the next step we're going to publish the table `tbl_countries` as a new layer.

* Open the terminal and insert the following command to create a new feature
  type (and layer) named `countries_rest`:
```bash
$ curl \
    -v \
    -u admin:momo-ws \
    -XPOST \
    -H "Content-type: text/xml" \
    -d "<featureType>
          <name>countries_rest</name>
          <nativeName>tbl_countries</nativeName>
          <title>Countries</title>
          <nativeCRS>EPSG:4326</nativeCRS>
          <enabled>true</enabled>
        </featureType>" \
  {{ book.geoServerBaseUrl }}/rest/workspaces/momo-rest/datastores/db_momo_ws_rest/featuretypes
```
* And again, verify that the response contains the lines
```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
```
and
```
Location: {{ book.geoServerBaseUrl }}/rest/workspaces/momo-rest/datastores/db_momo_ws_rest/featuretypes/countries_rest
```
* Additionally we can also have a look at the [preview page]({{ book.geoServerBaseUrl }}/momo-rest/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetMap&layers=momo-rest:countries_rest&styles=&bbox=-181.800003051758,-90.8681716918945,181.800018310547,84.5022735595703&width=768&height=370&srs=EPSG:4326&format=application/openlayers)
   to ensure the layer is correctly published.

## Create and upload style

We can use the REST API both to create a new style object in GeoServer and to
insert an existing SLD-file into it. At first we need to create a new SLD file
on our local machine we'll need in the next step. For this purpose we can use
the style already used in the previous [module](../../basics/publishing/vector/vectorstyle.md).

* Open the terminal and navigate to your home directory with:
```
$ cd ~
```
* Create and open a new SLD file `countries-style.sld` in this directory with:
```
$ nano countries-style.sld
```
* Copy the linked SLD content ([see here](../../basics/publishing/vector/vectorstyle.md))
  the newly created file and save it with `Ctrl + O`. You can now close the
  nano editor with `Ctrl + X`.

We will now create the style and upload the SLD file we just created.

* Copy the following block into your terminal and execute it to create a new
  style object:
```bash
$ curl \
    -v \
    -u admin:momo-ws \
    -XPOST \
    -H "Content-type: text/xml" \
    -d "<style>
          <name>countries_rest</name>
          <filename>countries-style.sld</filename>
        </style>" \
    {{ book.geoServerBaseUrl }}/rest/workspaces/momo-rest/styles
```
* And again, verify that the response contains the lines
```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
```
and
```
Location: http://localhost:80/geoserver/rest/workspaces/momo-rest/styles/countries_rest
```
* Afterwards we can upload the style created above with (Note: Ensure the path
  to file `countries-style.sld` is correct!):
```bash
$ curl \
    -v \
    -u admin:momo-ws \
    -XPUT \
    -H "Content-type: application/vnd.ogc.sld+xml" \
    -d @countries-style.sld \
    {{ book.geoServerBaseUrl }}rest/workspaces/momo-rest/styles/countries_rest
```
* This command should complete with:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

## Assign a layer style

After we have created the style, we can assign this style to the layer
`countries_rest`.

* Copy and execute the following command in the terminal window:
```bash
$ curl \
    -v \
    -u admin:momo-ws \
    -XPUT \
    -H "Content-type: text/xml" \
    -d "<layer>
          <defaultStyle>
            <name>countries_rest</name>
            <workspace>momo-rest</workspace>
          </defaultStyle>
        </layer>" \
    {{ book.geoServerBaseUrl }}/rest/layers/momo-rest:countries_rest
```
* After finished with `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` we can open the [preview page]({{ book.geoServerBaseUrl }}/momo-rest/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetMap&layers=momo-rest:countries_rest&styles=&bbox=-181.800003051758,-90.8681716918945,181.800018310547,84.5022735595703&width=768&height=370&srs=EPSG:4326&format=application/openlayers)
  to review the changes made to the layer style.
